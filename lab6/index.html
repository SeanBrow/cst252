<h2> Challenge </h2>
<p> Finding the various types of arrays and commands that are used for javascript.</p>
<h2> Problem </h2>
<p>Slight errors that were hard to define in the code. It took a few minutes to find the error. Had some issues with understanding the structures of the consol because they were a little different than the usual javascript but we figured it out after a ton of trial and error. </p>
	<h2> Result: </h2>
