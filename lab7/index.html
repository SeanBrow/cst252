<h1>Lab 7 - Arrays and Objects </h1>
<p>Working with your partner, write functions that take user input.</p>
<h2> Challenge </h2>
<p>The challenge of the lab is to create a function in javascript to do a specific action and to print out the result into the HTML page. Another challenge would also be to debug it and solve the problem by using w3schools.
</p>
	<h2> Problem </h2>
	<p>The javascript file  took a while to get used to and find the small errors that were causing the problems. Minor mistakes like periods and spaces tended to be the main issue but once we inspected a sample page we were able to pinpoint the bug and resolve it with trial and error.
