<h1>Lab 8 -Anon Functions and Callbacks </h1>
<p></p>
<h2> Challenge </h2>
<p>The challenge of the lab is to experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>1.) Why did we have to use console.log() and not old friend document.writeln()? Try it to see what happens.</dt>
	<dd> -From the looks of it, the javascript printed the text twice. It also seems to just make the entire site white, only allowing you to see the printed text.</dd>
	<dt>2.) Can you use document.getElementById("output") and a "div id="output"" so that the results of setTimeout() appear in our page? There is a way, but it is not easy.</dt>
	<dd> -Yes. see Screenshot of javascript bonus code. (however, it seems that it won’t load it into the div tag, even the console says it’s fine.)</dd>
	<dt>3.) What other common methods use callbacks? Can you implement it on your page?</dt>
<dd>	-Other methods such as static void, class and class are a few callback methods.</dd>
	<dt>4.) Can you create your own function that takes a callback as a parameter and runs it?</dt>
	Yes


</dl>

	<h2> Problem </h2>
	<p> The javascript file  took a while to get used to and find the small errors that were causing the problems. While working on the task x bonus using the ElementById("output"), it said its fine on console but it isn't printing on the page.
 </p>
	<h2> Result: </h2>
	<div>
        <h2>Script Output</h2>
        <p> Go to console to see the results. </p>
<div id="output">
    </div>
	</div>
</div>
</body>
