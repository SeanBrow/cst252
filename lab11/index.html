<h1>Lab 11: Conditionals</h1>
<p></p>
<h2> Challenge </h2>
<dl>
<p>Define Javascript events and use them in your code and to apply JavaScript to read HTML form content. </p>
<dt>Can you make it return a description of the Hogwarts house?</dt>
<dd>Yes, Either by more information in return or as its own array type. It is more preferred to do an Array.</dd>
<dt>The process of writing code and then rewriting it to make it simpler, more elegant, or more efficient is called refactoring. Can you refactor your code to make it simpler?</dt>
<dd>Yes. For Example: for Array you can go put it in by array.house ( house.house).</dd>
<dt>Can you make it so it is easy to add more houses to your list?</dt>
<dd>Yes. Plus, you can organize items and such into a different subject.</dd>
</dl>
	<h2> Problems </h2>
	<p>When trying to randomize the hash code and working on getting the array to work and print onto the html page took a while to get working. Some of the code has to be looked into such as the CharcodeAt to understand how it works.
 </p>
			<h2>Result  </h2>
			<div class="input">
				<h2> Welcome to Hogwats </h2>
				<p> You will be sorted into your house. </p>
				<input type="text"  id="input">
				<button id="button"> Click me!</button>
