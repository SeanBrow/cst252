<h1>Lab 12: Loops</h1>
		<p></p>
<h2> Challenge </h2>
<dl>
<dt>	Can you add an additional factor?
<dd>		Yes, you can add additional factors for specific numbers.</dd>
<dt>	Can you avoid hardcoded values in your code, and define a few constants at the top of your code that make it easier to change values and text?</dt>
<dd>		No.</dd>
	<dt>	Can you create a form that allows us to change the max number we loop through?</dt>
		<dd>Yes, slight modifications with an input and use a similar factor similar to the previous lab.</dd>
<dt>	Can you add form fields that allow you to change the factors we are looking for and the text that gets reported?</dt>
	<dd>	Yes. Though it would mean to entirely change the javascript codes.</dd>
<dt>		Can you style the output so it prints neatly in columns?</dt>
  <dd>		Yes. by making a class or modifying the div. By typing column width, three variations are put into the tag, each one for a different website.</dd>
</dl>

	<h2> Problems </h2>
	<p>While most of the code is similar to the in-class work, there are a few drawbacks when trying to modify it into a different code to let the user type what they want into specific parts of the factor.
